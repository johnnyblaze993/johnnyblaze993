- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonathan Alvarez!

- 👀 I’m interested in expressing my creativity through illustrations, figma designs, and creating projects!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN stack.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of project really! I know that sounds vague, but it's interesting 
     for me to see how others work through their development process. Working with others that have a different 
     approach, to me, is a valuable learning experience.

- 📫 How to reach me: https://johnalva.me/

- ⭐️ My favorite pokémon is Slowpoke.
